### Rekomendasi Kursus Online
An online course recommendation app using TensorFlow model to find the best result for you.


### Features and Integrations
- Authentication system (Google Login)
- Using machine learning model to get course(s) recommendations based on user's preferences
- Save and sync your course(s) recommendations to your Google Account.
- Dark mode, of course..

This project serves as my final project and is based on [CourseMate](https://github.com/CourseMate-Capstone-Project)

What's the difference?
- Jetpack Compose framework with Google Material Design
- Firebase integration for its authentication system
- Cloud-based processing model to in-app model, get recommendations without needing to connect to the internet.
